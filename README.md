# Moving average trading strategy implementation
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__*
This repository consists of two codes that were created as a final project for either a Scientific Python class and a Data Visualization class. The strategy I 
implemented is as easy as it seems: the reason was to check whether it works in essentially any configuration of the famous MA strategy.
Comparison with the Buy and Hold strategy was made, and I happened to create such strategies, that beat that.
